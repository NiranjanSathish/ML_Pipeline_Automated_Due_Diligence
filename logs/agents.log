2025-12-09 12:21:59,683 INFO [Evaluator] Evaluation: REJECT - The answer contains significant factual inaccuracies regarding Apple's reported revenue figures and year-over-year changes for the specified periods. The primary revenue figure ($102.5 billion for the September quarter with an 8% YoY increase) is incorrect based on Apple's actual financial reports (Apple's Q4 FY23 revenue was $89.5 billion, a 1% decrease YoY). Additionally, the inclusion of precise 'foreign pretax earnings' for future years (2025) presented as past performance is highly suspicious and likely a hallucination or misinterpretation of forecasted data. The answer also mixes different reporting periods (September quarter and Q1 2024) in a confusing manner, leading to further potential misattribution of data. (Confidence: 0.20, Hallucination: 0.90)
