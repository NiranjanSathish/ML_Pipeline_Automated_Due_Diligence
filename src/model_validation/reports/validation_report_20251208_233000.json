The **$4.9 billion** increase in OI&E from 2022 to 2023 was attributed to fluctuations in the value of equity securities, reflecting market-driven changes in marketable equity securities and investment-specific event-driven changes in non-marketable equity securities. The **$6.0 billion** increase in OI&E from 2023 to 2024 was primarily due to net gains on equity securities, specifically net unrealized gains on non-marketable equity securities driven by fair value adjustments related to observable transactions, partially offset by a decrease in net unrealized gains on marketable equity securities due to market-driven changes. Furthermore, the company recognized an **$8.0 billion** unrealized gain on non-marketable equity securities in January 2025.\n\n**Data Gaps/Limitations**\n\nThe specific carrying values (i.e., the actual dollar amounts) of marketable and non-marketable equity securities are not explicitly stated in the provided documents for December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024. The data only provides the *changes* in OI&E, which are influenced by the fluctuations in the value of these securities.

However, the cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased by **$713 million**, or **58%**, over the same period.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\n*   Cost of automotive sales revenue decreased by **$2.44 billion** or **18%** for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to March 31, 2024.\n*   Cost of services and other revenue increased by **$330 million**, or **15%**, for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to March 31, 2024.\n*   Cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased by **$713 million**, or **58%**, for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to March 31, 2024.\n\n**Detailed Analysis**\n\nThe decrease in the cost of automotive sales revenue is attributed to decreased deliveries year-over-year, lower raw material costs, and a positive impact from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies, partially offset by sales mix. The increase in the cost of services and other revenue is generally in line with the changes in services and other revenue. The increase in cost of energy generation and storage revenue was primarily due to increases in Megapack and Powerwall deployments compared to the prior year, with decreased average cost per unit for Megapack and Powerwall due to lower raw material costs.\n\n**Data Gaps/Limitations**\n\nThe total cost of revenues for Tesla Inc. for the three months ended March 31, 2025 is not explicitly stated in the provided documents. The documents only provide segmented cost of revenue information for automotive sales, services and other, and energy generation and storage. To calculate the total cost of revenues, one would need to sum the cost of revenues from each segment, but this is not possible with the available data.\n```",
